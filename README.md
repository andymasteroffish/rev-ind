# rev-ind
rev-ind is a bash script to cleanly reverse-indent any file.

I created this tool because I was sick of reverse-indenting by hand. Simply specify the input file and the output file and rev-ind will invert the indentation of your program.

![An example of rev-ind being used on some nasty, terrible to look at code](img/preview_image.jpg?raw=true)

##Usage

```
./rev-ind.sh my_bad_old_code.js my_very_good_code.js
```

##Afterword

This is my first bash script and I am completely uninterested in feedback. Do not waste your time or mine.

However, if you would like to tell me about how rev-ind has improved your workflow/changed your life, please hit me up on twitter [@andy_makes](https://twitter.com/Andy_Makes)
